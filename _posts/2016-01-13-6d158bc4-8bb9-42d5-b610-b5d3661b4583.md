# Welcome to Visions from Asheville

This site presents the thoughts and ramblings of Asheville Visions Photography as well as commentary and news articles from the Asheville community. It is an intellectual (or not!) perspective from Western North Carolina and Appalachia on just about anything. Your comments, criticisms, and (dis)agreements are solicited and most welcome.
